This is a simple Plymouth theme displaying the Arch Linux logo.

Created with GIMP, both PNGs and the GIF sample. Sorry for the crappy quality of the second one, but I don't know how to do it properly.

[=============== Installation ===============]
1. Move the extracted 'arch-glow' directory to plymouth themes directory:
   # mv arch-glow /usr/share/plymouth/themes/

2. Set correct ownership to the 'arch-glow' theme files:
   # chown -R root.root /usr/share/plymouth/themes/arch-glow

3. Set the 'arch-glow' theme as default, editing the following file *
   # nano -w /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   [Daemon]
   Theme=arch-glow
   ShowDelay=5

4. Reboot the kernel image (you have to repeat this step every time a theme is changed):
   # mkinitcpio -p <name of your kernel preset; e.g. linux>

   [Optional]
   You can also do the two previous steps at once:
   # plymouth-set-default-theme -R arch-glow

5. Reboot to apply the changes.

* Note: As of version 0.9.0 Plymouth has a new configuration file:
        /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf
